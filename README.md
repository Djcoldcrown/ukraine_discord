# ukraine_discord
A script that gets the news from liveuamap.com to post is on Discord as a webhook

# Live view
The bot is currently running and posting news right now as an example inside [my personal Discord server](https://discord.gg/AlexFlipnote), inside the channel `#general_whatever` within the thread called `Ukraine Vs Russia - Discussion and News`.

# Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Discord webhook URL
# You are free to use this code
